I normally don't watch a ton of TV, but on my maternity leave while holding/playing with/changing/carrying my baby I had _a lot_ of things on the big screen to occupy my brain as my hands were full! This is a list of the TV shows I saw (or at least had on in the background), in no particular order. I watched movies too (mostly musical ones so I could sing to the baby) but I can't be bothered to list those as well.

## Shows I watched

- [Girls5Eva](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11650492/) (funniest show I've seen in a really long time)
- [Veep](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/)
- [Bloodhounds](https://www.netflix.com/title/81444051) (so violent and very much a bro show, but well done)
- [Poker Face](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14269590/) (the TWISTS)
- [Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/)
- [Ted Lasso](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/) (very wholesome, not my favorite show in the world but it was a nice show)
- [Project Runway](https://www.bravotv.com/project-runway)
- [Top Chef](https://www.bravotv.com/top-chef)
- [Survivor](https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/)

## Shows I re-watched

- [The Office: Superfan episodes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27738382/) (added some new elements to the show that were so great)
- [Community](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439629/)
- [Business Proposal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14819828/) (one of my fave k-dramas!)
- [Alone](https://www.history.com/shows/alone)
- [Kim's Convenience](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5912064/) (never watched it all the way through before, and I am very sad it was cancelled)
- [Grace & Frankie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3609352/)
- [Black-ish](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3487356/)

## Shows I purposely didn't finish

- [Suits](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/) (stopped around season 3, there was a lot of "if you don't tell the truth, I WILL" and I got tired of it)
- [The Good Wife](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442462/) (too serious)
- [Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12225230/)
- [Hack my Home](https://www.netflix.com/title/81319212)
- [Sweet Tooth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12809988/)
- [Siren: Survive the Island](https://www.netflix.com/title/81631016) (just lost interest on this one)
- [Workin' Moms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6143796/)
- [Beef](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/) (a little too intense for me)
- [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) (same)
- [Schmigadoon! Season 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11808942/)
- [Mythic Quest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/)

- [The Morning Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/)
- [I Love That For You](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9319706/) (I couldn't handle the cringe)
- [What if...?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10168312/)
