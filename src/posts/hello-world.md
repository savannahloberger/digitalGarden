I decided to make my own little blog, but... more like the concept of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Sometimes I might update this a lot, sometimes I might not.

I want to have a space where I can write anything, not have it be confined to tech things, and not worry about it being particularly polished. That's what this is!

I built this in Astro, I pulled in some posts from blogs past, and... here we gooo!
