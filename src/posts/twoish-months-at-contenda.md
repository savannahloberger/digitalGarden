It's kind of hard to believe that it's been two months at Contenda, mostly because time has passed both super fast and super slow. It's a significantly more busy job than I had at Remote. I've got a lot of meetings, and folks reporting to me, and code to write... but it's not overwhelming!

I think what I like the most about the role is that I feel valuable, honestly. Everyone is so fun and the memes are flowing, which is very high on the "likes" list, but I really like being in a place where I feel like I'm making a difference. At my previous job I felt like everything I did was very "extra" and not really essential to the business, and the one before was so politically driven that I burnt out from that. But here... it's different. The team is smaller, there's a lot of potential, there's a lot to do, but it all feels meaningful and something that I'm interested in. That's a rare thing to find!

Right now is a particularly busy time with our CEO being concussed (sucks, Lilly) and the holidays rapidly approaching and our API+platform being built from scratch, but it's a good busy. I think finding that "good busy" is rare, and with any luck we'll be able to keep it up for good, and I can help take Contenda alllllll the way to the mooooon!
