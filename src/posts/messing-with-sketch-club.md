So a little while back I got the app [Sketch Club](http://app.sketchclub.com/), but I never really did anything with it besides using it to annotate photos.

But recently, I decided to stop playing games on the subway and instead try my hand at drawing instead. My conclusion: Sketch Club is AWESOME.
It handles different brushes, layers, layer styles, recordings of drawings, and it's constantly being updated!

I personally like drawing cartoony-style doodles, here's a couple that I did recently:

(If you play the game Neko Atsume, you'll understand the inspiration behind this one)

I still have to improve myself on shading and drawing things other than animals that seem destructive. But hey, it's a great stress reliever, and it's a fun way to feel productive on the way to work. :)
