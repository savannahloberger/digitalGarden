Welcome to this blog, er rather digital garden, 
More about me here: [Savannah](https://technicallysavi.com/about)!

This site is using Astro and TinaCMS. You can [clone the same template I did on GitHub](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg) to use it for yourself!

Posts are written in markdown and any writings pre winter 2024 have been imported in. 

You should also check out (in no particular order): 
 - [cassidoo's newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), or my word game [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/?utm_campaign=blahgtmp&utm_source=github), or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cassidoo).

Take chance, make mistakes, and follow your dreams.
All the best!
